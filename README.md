My website is for a fictional startup called Rob's Radishes.
I have a home page with a clickable image that takes users to an "about us" section.
From there, users can navigate to read about the benefits of radishes.
Finally, users can click on the "see more" link to see more pics of radishes. One note, the bulk of my 'pics.html code sits in the header section as opposed to the body. I know the bulk should be in the body but I wanted to include the bolded 'h3' size headers.
